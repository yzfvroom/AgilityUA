Lab 3: SSO Lab
===========================

The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate Single Sign-On capabilities
of APM.    The SSO Credential Mapping action enables users to forward
stored user names and passwords to applications and servers automatically,
without having to input credentials repeatedly.   This allows single
sign-on (SSO) functionality for secure user access.  As different applications
and resources support different authentication mechanisms, the SSO system
may be required to store and translate credentials that differ from the
user name and password a user inputs on the logon page.  The SSO credential
mapping action allows for credentials to be retrieved from the logon
page, or in another way for both the user name and the password.

This lab will demonstrate one SSO method, although a number of different SSO
methods exist.  This lab will demonstrate the Kerberos to SAML method.

Objective:

-  Gain an understanding of SSO Token User Name Caching and SSO Token Password
   Caching.

-  Gain an understanding of the Kerberos to SAML relationship and its
   component parts.

-  Develop an awareness of the different deployment models that Kerberos
   to SAML authentication opens up

Lab Requirements:

-  All Lab requirements will be noted in the tasks that follow

Estimated completion time: 15 minutes

TASK 1: Create an SSO object and Webtop Resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

______________________________________________________________

SAML Resource

#.  Begin by selecting Access > Federation > SAML Resources


#.  Click the Create button (far right)


#.  In the New SAML Resource window, enter the following values:

	Name			 	partner-app

	SSO Configuration	prebuilt-idp.acme.com

	Caption				partner-app


Click Finished at the bottom of the configuration window

Webtop

#.	Select Access > Webtops > Webtop List

#.	Click Create button (far right)

#.	In the resulting window, enter the following values

	Name	full_webtop
	Type	Full (drop down)

Click finished at the bottom of the GUI


TASK 2 – Configure an Active Directory account, Kerberos AAA Object, and keytab file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
______________________________________________________________

#. During this exercise we will make a copy of the idp.acme.com-policy and modify
   it to demonstrate Kerberos to SAML functionality.  Navigate to Access, Profiles, Access Profiles
   and click on the Copy link to the far right of the idp.acme.com-policy.   Name the policy Kerberos_SAML.
   

#.  From the Jump Host open a command prompt and type "mmc".   This will launch the Active Directory Management 
console.   Click on Active Directory Users and Computers.


#.  Create a new user in Active Directory with the follow attributes:


#  The Active Directory account shold be name "kerbsso".  


#. The next step is the run the ktpass command from the Windows command line as follows below


**ktpass /princ HTTP/kerberos.f5lab@ACME.COM /mapuser f5lab\kerberos /ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL /pass password /out c:\file.keytab**


#. Configure a Kerberos AAA Object 


#. Create the AAA object by navigating to **Access, Authentication, Kerberos


# Specify a **Name** (AD Domain)


#. Specify the **Auth Realm** (Active Directory Domain)


#. Browse to locate the Keytab file (The Keytab file should be located at c:\file.keytab)


#. Click Finished to complete the creation of the AAA object


#.  Review the AAA server configuration at Access, Authentication

TASK 4 - Test the Kerberos to SAML Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
______________________________________________________________

.. NOTE:: In the following Lab Task it is recommended that you use Microsoft
   Internet Explorer.  While other browsers also support Kerberos
   (if configured), for the purposes of this Lab Microsoft Internet
   Explorer has been configured and will be used.

#. Using Internet Explorer from the jump host, navigate to the SAML IdP you
   previously configured at *idp.acme.com* (or click the
   provided bookmark)

#. Were you prompted for credentials? Were you successfully authenticated?
   Did you see the webtop with the SP application?

#. Click on the Partner App icon. Were you successfully authenticated
   (via SAML) to the SP?

#. Review your Active Sessions **(Access ‑> Overview ‑> Active Sessions­­­)**

#. Review your Access Report Logs **(Access ‑> Overview ‑> Access Reports)**
